# Non-JP-Novelupdates
Just removing all lists that are not from Japanese origin in Novelupdates.
To use this, you need to enable "Enable Origin Tagging (No Colors)" in Account Setting > Site Settings.

Created by ChatGPT, modified by DeepSeek. I'm just archiving it because I don't want to forget the script. 

To install, click [this](https://github.com/volcbs/Non-JP-Novelupdates/raw/main/userscript.user.js) but you need to have extension like violentmonkey, greasemonkey, etc.

Use it at your discretion
